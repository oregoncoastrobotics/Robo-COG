send_stream
  -Streams video to stdout or network via TCP
  -Seems unstable, sometimes 8 FPS, sometimes 30 FPS on my machine (via wireless)
  -Tries to listen again after client socket is closed, but only works in some situations
  -Test with the following command line:  send_stream -d /dev/video0 -s -f -c 0
  

  
Many things hard coded in above files that will need to be configurable later on.

  -Sability problem seems to be have been with receiving app, stable at 30FPS now
