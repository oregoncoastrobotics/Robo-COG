Robot Cognitive Operation Gateway

We should probably talk about repository naming before I'm turned loose on GIT :)

This repository houses the design plan, hardware documents and links to software for our robots' brains.

The design goal (reflected in the name) is that we would have a compact, networkable "cognative system" (processor, I/O and core sensors) which would provide "gateway" access to higher cognitive functions than would be practical on-board.
