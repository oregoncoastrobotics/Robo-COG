# Robo-COG


Robot Cognitive Operation Gateway


This repository houses the design plan, hardware documents and links to software for our robots' brains.

The design goal (reflected in the name) is that we would have a compact, networkable "cognative system" (processor, I/O and core sensors) which would provide "gateway" access to higher cognitive functions than would be practical on-board.
