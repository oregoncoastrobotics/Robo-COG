To build send_stream I started with a debian based system and did the following:

Installed the build-essential package (sudo apt-get install build-essential), which includes gcc and standard c libraries
Installed the pkg-config package
Installed the linux-kernel-headers package which turns out was linux-libc-dev and was already installed (by build-essentials?)
Installed the libv4l-dev package

I cd to ~ make a bin directory there copy the build_send_stream and send_stream.c files to ~ and run build_send_stream
