To build send_stream I started with a debian based system and did the following:


```
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y
sudo apt-get install pkg-config -y
sudo apt-get install linux-libc-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev -y

mkdir ~/bin
mkdir /tmp

cp send_stream/build_send_stream.sh /tmp
cp send_stream/send_stream.c /tmp

# You may need to adjust 
/tmp/send_stream -c0 -s -f -d /dev/video0
cp tmp/send_stream ~/bin

```

Installed the build-essential package (sudo apt-get install build-essential), which includes gcc and standard c libraries
Installed the pkg-config package
Installed the linux-kernel-headers package which turns out was linux-libc-dev and was already installed (by build-essentials?)
Installed the libv4l-dev package

I cd to ~ make a bin directory (mkdir bin) then copy the build_send_stream and send_stream.c files to ~ and run build_send_stream

send_stream -c0 -s -f -d /dev/video0
