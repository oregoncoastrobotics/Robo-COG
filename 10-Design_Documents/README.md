Design Documents
================

- The Design_Requirements document should reflect our over-arching needs, wants, nice-to-haves and goals for our robot COG (hereafter COG)
- The Hardware_Design document should contain specifics of the hardware architecture for the COG
- The Software_Design document should contain specifics of the software architecture for the COG
- There may be one or more documents in a Trade_Studies folder which offer insight into design decisions for specific elements of the COG
