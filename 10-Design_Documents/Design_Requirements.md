R-COG Design
============

Note:  I expect the below paragraph to go away at some point.
Per our phone discussion 12-27-14 and the desire to create a list of "core" functionality and/or sensors for our robots I decided to create this document to record these and other requirements for our robot's "brain".  I expect this to be a "living" document, updated and modified as necessary to reflect our current design goals.


+ Core Goals
  - "Cloud" Cognition
  - Mobility
  - Portability
  - Navigation
  - Affordability

+ Stretch Goals
  - Interactivity
  - World Domination :)
